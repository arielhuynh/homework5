Unit 05 Third-Party APIs Homework: Day Planner

I created this application so I can organize my day accordingly. Haven't you had those days where you have so much to do, but feel like you don't have enough time or don't remember everything? This application will help you organize your day to day tasks! Sometimes work gets so busy, we have to make sure we schedule or lunch breaks to get out of the office and get some fresh air.
